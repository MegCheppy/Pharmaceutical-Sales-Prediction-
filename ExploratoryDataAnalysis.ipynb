    "Task 1 - Exploration of customer purchasing behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory data analysis is the lifeblood of every meaningful machine learning project. It helps us unravel the nature of the data and sometimes informs how you go about modeling. A careful exploration of the data encapsulates checking all available features, checking their interactions and correlation as well as their variability with respect to the target. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you seek to explore the behaviour of customers in the various stores. Our goal is to check how some measures such as promos and opening of new stores affect purchasing behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this goal, you need to first clean the data. The data cleaning process will involve building pipelines to detect and handle outlier and missing data. This is particularly important because you donâ€™t want to skew our analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizing various features and interactions is necessary for clearly communicating our findings. It is a powerful tool in the data science toolbox. Communicate the findings below via the necessary plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the following questions as a guide during your analysis. It is important to come up with more questions to explore. This is part of our expectation for an excellent analysis.\n",
